                        <h3> Kare-kare</h3>
                        Kare-kare is a Philippine stew that features a thick savory peanut sauce. It is generally made from a base of stewed oxtail, 
                        beef tripe, pork hocks, calves feet, pig's feet or trotters, various cuts of pork, beef stew meat, and occasionally offal.
                        Kare-kare is my comfort food. It was the food my mother cooks occasionally and when something special came up. I like cooking
                        just like my mother. And I often cook this recipe to my friends.

                        <h3>The Greem Mile</h3>
                        This is a story of a person who was accused of a murder he didn't commit. I watched this movie when I was on 3rd grade and 
                        I never forget about it. I can watch this movie for hundred of time but never get sick of it.
