            Watercolour is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. Watercolour refers to both the medium and the resulting artwork. In fine art painting, the term 'Watercolour' denotes a painting medium in which colour pigments are bound in water-soluble agents. Originally, these binders were animal glues or certain sugars, but nowadays the standard substance is gum arabic. A variety of additives can be used (eg. honey, glycerin) to increase plasticity and create other effects. Watercolours are generally applied by sable or squirrel-hair brushes onto white tinted paper or card, although supports can encompass canvas, leather, and papyrus. Watercolours are a highly versatile medium, they can be applied to everything from paper to canvas, stone, wood and fabrics. Watercolor is transparent yet can be made opaque, either for accent or over the entire surface, through repeated wash applications.

        <h1> History of Watercolour Painting</h1>
        <p > 
            Watercolour art dates from Stone Age cave painting when early Paleolithic man first painted pictures of animals and humans on their caves using charcoal, ochre and other natural pigments. It was later popularized in Egyptian art after the discovery of papyrus (paper). However, papyrus is very fragile and the only paintings that have survived from the Ancient Egyptian era are those that were buried in pyramids in dry conditions. In traditional Chinese art, watercolours developed around 4,000 BCE, primarily as a medium of decorative art. By the 4th century CE, watercolour landscapes had become established as an independent form of Chinese painting, and would eventually dominate all Chinese brush painting. For a guide to the principles behind Oriental fine arts and crafts, see: Traditional Chinese Art: Characteristics. During the Middle Ages in Europe, watercolours were used to create illuminated manuscripts and colour maps. During the era of Renaissance art they were used to make portrait miniatures or create studies from nature.

                <p> 
                    Watercolor painting emerged in Europe during the Renaissance period with advancements in papermaking. While early European artists prepared their own watercolor mixtures for fresco wall painting, this was soon applied to paper. With an increase in the availability of synthetic pigments, printmaker and Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) developed new methods of working with watercolor paints, highlighting the luminous, transparent effects it offered and inspiring other artists to experiment. This trend was picked up by Hans Bol (1534–1593), who founded an important school of watercolor painting in Germany as part of the Dürer Renaissance.

                <p>
                    During the Middle Ages, monks of Europe used tempera to create illuminated manuscripts. These books were considered a major form of art, equivalent to easel painting in later years. Taking many years of service to complete, the monks copied the scriptures by hand onto sheets of parchment made from sheepskin, or vellum made from calfskin. Sometimes, entire pages were decorated with elaborate scrollwork and symbolic images.

            <li><b>The English Watercolor Movement and Its Influence on Modern Art</b>  </li>
                <p>
                    Watercolor painting really gained a foothold in Western art during the 18th century, particularly in England where Paul Sandby (1730–1809), an English map-maker turned painter (and one of the founders of the Royal Academy), used the watercolor paints so popular in the creation of maps for his landscape paintings.    This group was active from the late 18th century to the mid 19th century, the so-called Golden Age of Watercolour. The unique effects of light and freer brushwork created by the English school of watercolor painting caught the attention of the early Impressionists and influenced their work.  nitially the artists restricted their paintings to tint washes. A restricted range of colours were allowed, but the overall effect was quite monochromatic. While some artists continued to create tinted drawings, others began to push the boundaries and began using a wider palette of stronger colours to create a more painterly effect.   Watercolours soon became popular throughout the UK with for wildlife and plant paintings, as well as new demands for plein-air painters. To accompany archeological and anthropological expeditions around the globe in order to document images of flora and fauna. A new Romantic style of watercolour painting emerged. Using rough-textured paper, paint was applied with a freer brushwork to capture fleeting effects in the landscape.

        <h1> Watercolour Societies in the history of watercolor painting </h1>
        <ul>
            <li"> <b>England</b></li>
                 <p>
                      In 1804, a faction of overseeing watercolorists organized the Society of Painters in Water-Colours, later to evolve the Royal Watercolour Society (RWS). Organizing members encompassed Francis Nicholson, Samuel Shelley, William Frederick Wells, John Glover, William Henry Pyne, and Robert Hills. Recent notable units include Dame Elizabeth Violet Blackadder, the Scottish painter, and printmaker. 
                </p>
            <li><b>Ireland</b> </li>
                <p>
                    In the Republic, the Watercolour Society of Ireland (WCSI) was founded in 1870. Over the years, members of the WCSI have included such famous Irish artists as Rose Barton (1856-1929), George Campbell (1917-79), Lilian Davidson (1893-1954), Gerard Dillon (1916-71), Percy French (1854-1920), Mildred Anne Butler (1858-1941), Letitia Hamilton (1878-1964), Paul Henry (1876-1958), Harry Kernoff (1900-74), Maurice McGonigal (1900-79), Nora McGuinness (1901-80), Frank McKelvey (1895-1974), Walter Osborne (1859-1903), Nano Reid (1905-81), George Russell (AE) (1867-1935), and Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957). In Northern Ireland, the Ulster Watercolour Society (UWS) has been the leading body. Members of the latter have included such distinguished artists as Gladys MacCabe (b.1918) and Maurice Wilks (1910-84).

            <li><b>America</b> </li>
                <p>
                    Watercolors were also taken up by American artists, notably Winslow Homer (1836-1910), strongly influenced by the Barbizon School, William Trost Richards (1833-1905), Henry Roderick Newman, and John LaFarge (1835-1910). The American Watercolour Society (originally, the American Society of Painters in Watercolour) was established in 1866.

                    A significant contribution to the history of color painting in the twentieth-century has included the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944), the Swiss Paul Klee (1879-1940), and the French expressionist painter Raoul Dufy (1877-1953). In the United States, crucial watercolor artists included: Thomas Eakins (1844-1916), John Marin (1870-1953), Maurice Prendergast (1859-1924), Edward Hopper (1882-1967), Lyonel Feininger (1871-1956), and Andrew Wyeth (1917-2009). American art activities supporting watercolor art comprised both the Ohio School (from the Cleveland Museum of Art) and the California Scene (from the CalArts Academy).

        <ol>
            <li><b> The wash</b></li>
                <p>
                    This is the most used technique, and the one that defines watercolor for many artists. You create a wash by first abundantly wetting the paper with your mop, and then applying the watercolor pigment with either your mop or your point. You typically use a wash for your backgrounds, and you use it to create large colored areas. Gradients can be achieved by layering the pigment through several parallel brush strokes with increasingly diluted color, and by slopping the paper to control the flow of water. To do a good wash, you must:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>use a lot of water</li>
                        <li> paint quickly</li>
                        <li>avoid going back to it or otherwise interfere with the drying process</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            <li style=><b> Wet on wet </b></li>
                <p>
                    It is a painting technique in which new paint is applied to previously applied paint that has not dried yet. Wet on wet painting allows the painter to continuously apply layers for corrosion prevention rather than waiting for each successive layer to dry. Wet on wet can also help with mixing paints.
                </p>
            <li><b>Wet on Dry </b></li>
                <p>
                    The wet on dry technique is rarely used except for lift offsyet it is extremely useful to bring life into “flat”areas of your painting or for several special effects. Wet on dry is achieved by applying water or water+pigment to a dry watercolor layer. You can then let the water sit or direct it by slopping the paper. Letting the water sit will create concentric circles of pigments over your dry layer. Directing the water can wash off specific areas of the painting.
                </p>
            <li><b> Dry brush</b></li>
                <p>  
                    Using a dry brush to apply pigment on dry paper allows you to create textures and tone graduations. You will want to use an old brush for this technique, as it will damage the brush. 
                </p>
            <li><b> Glazing</b></li>
                <p>
                    Glazing is a technique I usually avoid as I view it as unnecessary if you can successfully control your washes. There are many instance where it is required however and it can help you correct tonal values or reduce excessive color contrast. To glaze a layer, use transparent or semi-transparent pigments and apply a very thin layer over your dry background. You will then be able to modify the tonal value and/or the color of the background layer. 
                </p>
            <li><b> Lifting off</b></li>
                <p>
                    Lifting off paint is achieved by applying a sponge or a paper towel to wet areas of the painting. As you dry the area, you also remove pigments. Alternatively, you can apply water to a dry area and subsequently apply your paper towel to remove some of the dissolved pigments. Mostly, this technique is meant to correct mistakes.
                </p>
            <li><b> Pigment saturationand Pigment desaturation</b></li>
                <p>
                    Pigment saturation works by dropping dry pigment onto a wet layer or wash. You then let the pigment and the background layer dry in place, and brush off the pigment once the paper is completely dry. You will be left with a highly concentrated color dot that radiates a bit into the background layer; other patterns can result. Desaturation can be achieved by spreading coarse salt onto your wet layer. The salt will absorb some of the pigment; once both the salt and the background layer are dry, you can remove the salt and will be left we spots of desaturated color. Different size of grain salt allow you to achieve different results, and you can use other absorbent materials and crystals.
                </p>
            <li><b>Paper handling </b></li>
                <p>
                    You can achieve a number of effect by sloping and angling your paper. Painting a sky for instance is a lot easier if your paper is standing vertically as opposed to lying flat. The best thing to do is to experiment with gravity and to build a repertoire of positions and movements that work for you. You can also use your hair dryer to achieve similar results or “spot dispersions” when applying it to areas you are painting.
                </p>
            <li><b>Masking </b></li>
                <p> 
                    Masking fluid, masking tape, pieces of paper and of course your hands can be used to mask areas when applying washes or splatters. Use them and experiment.
