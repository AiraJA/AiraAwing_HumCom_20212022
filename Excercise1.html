    <p style= margin-left:5cm;margin-right:5cm;> The client was the very first novel I read written by <u>John Grisham.</u>
    The book tells of a boy named <u>Mark Sway</u> and his little brother <u>Ricky</u> witnessing the suicide of a mob lawyer. 
    Before he dies, he confides to <u>Mark</u> about vital information about a politician's murder.
    Fearing reprisal by the mob or the FBI for lying, he hires a lawyer to get him out of this mess.
     The story was a <span style= "color:red;"> <i><b>thriller with a humorous touch.</b></i> </span>
    I was thoroughly entertained for every minute of the book. The suspense was <span style= "color:red;"> <i><b>intense</b></i> </span>, 
    and the story was <span style= "color:red;"> <i><b>good</b></i> </span>. It was <span style= "color:red;"> <i><b>a real page turner</b></i> </span> and <span style= "color:red;"> <i><b>a well written book</b></i> </span>. </p>
